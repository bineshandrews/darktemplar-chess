      <section id="main_content">
        <p>DarkTemplar is my amateur attempt to make a functional chess engine. The focus was on creating a moderately strong engine (with readable code!) which implements most of the ideas/techniques used in a modern chess engine. The decision was to keep the code readable and organized rather than using obscure techniques to optimize the performance. Its been more than an year since I worked on this and I don't seem to find time to continue working on this. I am maintaining the repository in case any new chess enthusiast could get an overall idea of what they are dealing with.</p>

<p>The following features are supported in this initial release. 1. Support for the chess engine communication protocol which enables this engine to use the winboard/xboard/arena GUIs. 2. Support for polyglot opening book 3. Support Standard Arithmetic Notation (SAN, eg: Nf3) and Standard Co-ordinate Notation (eg: g1f3) for recording and parsing moves. 4. Support Forsyth-Edward Notation(FEN) for representing and re-creating board positions. 5. Alpha beta pruning for the nega-max search tree - This is a very basic requirement to speed up the decision making phase of the engine. 6. Zobrist hashing 7. A basic static board evaluation method 8. Identifying X-ray attacks, discovered checks, checkmate, stalemate, 3-move draw, 50-move draw detection.</p>

<p>.. and many more. :-)</p>

<p>The next things in line which could improve performance are: 1. Use Bitboards for generating moves 2. Implement Quiescence search for eliminating horizon effect 3. Aspiration window to build on alpha-beta pruning performance 4. A better static evaluation routine 5. Support for end game table bases (EGTB) 6. Timing and pondering support</p>
