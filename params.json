{"name":"Darktemplar-chess","body":"DarkTemplar is my amateur attempt to make a functional chess engine. The focus was on creating a moderately strong engine (with readable code!) which implements most of the ideas/techniques used in a modern chess engine. The decision was to keep the code readable and organized rather than using obscure techniques to optimize the performance. Its been more than an year since I worked on this and I don't seem to find time to continue working on this. I am maintaining the repository in case any new chess enthusiast could get an overall idea of what they are dealing with.\r\n\r\nThe following features are supported in this initial release. 1. Support for the chess engine communication protocol which enables this engine to use the winboard/xboard/arena GUIs. 2. Support for polyglot opening book 3. Support Standard Arithmetic Notation (SAN, eg: Nf3) and Standard Co-ordinate Notation (eg: g1f3) for recording and parsing moves. 4. Support Forsyth-Edward Notation(FEN) for representing and re-creating board positions. 5. Alpha beta pruning for the nega-max search tree - This is a very basic requirement to speed up the decision making phase of the engine. 6. Zobrist hashing 7. A basic static board evaluation method 8. Identifying X-ray attacks, discovered checks, checkmate, stalemate, 3-move draw, 50-move draw detection.\r\n\r\n.. and many more. :-)\r\n\r\nThe next things in line which could improve performance are: 1. Use Bitboards for generating moves 2. Implement Quiescence search for eliminating horizon effect 3. Aspiration window to build on alpha-beta pruning performance 4. A better static evaluation routine 5. Support for end game table bases (EGTB) 6. Timing and pondering support\r\n\r\nThe prior website for this project was http://sites.google.com/site/darktemplarchess Interested programmers could get links to useful information there.
